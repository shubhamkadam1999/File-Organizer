File-Organizer is used to organized the file based on the file extension type. 
it uses 2 modules 
1) OS module which is used for interacting with the operating system.
2) Shutil module offers high-level operation on a file like a copy, create, and remote operation on the file.

It takes input as a folder path name which is used to organized. and create a directory in that same folder based on the extension type. 
If the extension folder already exist then it will move the dedicated file
